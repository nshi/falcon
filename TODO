#+SEQ_TODO: TODO ACTIVE DONE

* General
** TODO [#C] Organize error handling code.						:Enhancement:
   Some places use error reporting infrastructure, but some use g_return_*.
** DONE [#C] Turn off debug message output by default.				:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-14 Mon 20:13]
** DONE [#B] Add static keyword to all private functions.				:Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-13 Sun 15:15]
** TODO [#C] Seperate private and public APIs.					:Enhancement:
** DONE [#A] Make components thread-safe.								:Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-15 Tue 21:34]
** TODO [#C] Clean up the code according to a coding standard.	:Enhancement:
** DONE [#A] Stop casting function pointers!							:Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 15:28]
** TODO [#A] It's probably scanning the same file multiple times! :Enhancement:
   Wait until trie is implemented.
* Handler
** DONE [#B] Handle changed event.									:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-14 Mon 20:12]
** DONE [#B] Allow user to pass a userdata to the custom handlers.	:Feature:

* Walker
** DONE [#A] Create object when walking.								:Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-11 Fri 23:55]
** DONE [#B] Allow watching a single directory and its descendants. :Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-17 Thu 12:42]
   Also allow user to stop watching a descendant of a watched directory. Set
   watchability in the walker, if the config says that we should watch then
   watch it, otherwise the watchability setting should be the same as its parent
   directory.
* Cache
** ACTIVE [#A] Implement trie and use it to store objects.		:Enhancement:
   This will greatly reduce the time spent on scanning. Currently the speed
   sucks.
* Falcon
** DONE [#B] Implement the main function.							:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-13 Sun 14:40]
** DONE [#B] Implement add_dir function.							:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-12 Sat 00:19]
** DONE [#C] Allow setting the watching flag of an object.			:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 16:00]
   If it's a directory, should propagate the watchability flag to its
   descendents.
** DONE [#B] Shutdown the system clearly, including clearing all the memory. :Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-13 Sun 15:16]
** TODO [#C] Dynamically control the size of the thread pool.	:Enhancement:
** DONE [#B] Check if the system is initialized first in every function. :Enhancement:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 15:44]
** TODO [#A] Fix changing watchability flag.							:Bug:
   Need to recursively change all its descendants.
* Watcher
** DONE [#B] Implement watcher.										:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-15 Tue 18:35]
** TODO [#A] Fix memory leak of monitors.								:Bug:
** DONE [#A] Delegate the handling to a walker.					:Enhancement:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 23:31]
   Don't handle changes by itself.
** DONE [#A] Newly created sub-directories are not watched.				:Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-20 Sun 13:29]
** DONE [#A] Normalize path before handing it to the walker.			:Bug:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-20 Sun 13:20]
   If it's an absolute path, do nothing. Otherwise, get the path relative to the
   current working directory.
* Config
** DONE [#B] Implement config loader.								:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-17 Thu 02:08]
** DONE [#B] Implement config writer.								:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-17 Thu 02:08]
* Events
** DONE [#B] Allow users to register a handler for all events.		:Feature:
   CLOSED: [2009-09-15 Tue 20:25]
* Object
** TODO [#C] We do need the accessors, we also need it for the name. :Enhancement:
* Trie
** ACTIVE [#A] Implement trie_foreach with depth-first traversal.	:Feature:
* Testing
** TODO [#C] Write unit tests.									:Enhancement:
